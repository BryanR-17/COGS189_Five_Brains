# **COGS 189 - Five Brains (Linguistic Interference EEG Project)**
This repository contains the code and analysis for our **COGS 189 project** on how **background music with understood lyrics vs instrumental vs non-understood lyrics** affects cognitive load, measured via **EEG Alpha and Beta band power**.

### **Project Structure**
